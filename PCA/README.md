# PCA (Principal Component Analysis

The PCA technique objective is to reduce the complexity of your machine learning model. But ther is a trade-off between complexity and accuracy/precision.
As the model loses complexity, often it will lose its ability to make right prediction or classifications. So it's crucial to analyse and test different PCA configurations
so the model can have the best result possible.

## pca.py
The pca.py file has an implementation of a PCA analysis in the Breast Cancer dataset provided inside the sklearn library. A 2 component PCA is done in the dataset and some
interesting plots comparing the components. In this case it's not applied to a real model for real inference, this repository's objective is to show how the PCA algorithm
can be written and how to understand the result data resulted from its implementation.
